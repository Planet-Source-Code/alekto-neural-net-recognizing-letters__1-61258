### Description

With this Code you can teach a Neural Net (=NN) , how the A-B-C looks like and make it recognize them! For every Letter there is 'Picture' (=5x5-"Pixels")! You teach your NN this Picture to the Letter you want it to! (What means: you can even tell your NN that a 'F' looks like a 'W' or whatever)

After teaching the NN the Letters, you can make (f.e.) a 'Picture' (= Letter-Code) that looks NOT EXACLTY the same as an "F" an the Neural Net will tell you that your NOT-EXACLTY-the-same-"F" looks mostly like an "F" ! =)

Modify pre-Definded-Letter-Codes in ... "\Data\Letter_Codes.txt"
